# Boston
Analysis of the Boston housing dataset, commonly used in teaching machine learning, to address ethical issues.

This repo is hosted in response to recent criticism of the discipline of mathematics as a White and cisheteropatriarchal space (source:https://www.foxnews.com/media/professor-argues-math-education-white-cisheteropatriarchal-limits-queer-trans-students-color). An example is given which demonstrates how the data science discipline can police itself in this regard. In a nutshell, the Boston dataset has been curated in several machine learning libraries but has recently been criticized, and deprecated in at least one of these libraries, as detailed here (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/16155). The purpose of this project is to repeat a machine learning exploration of the dataset, including a controversial variable documenting proportion of Black residents, and address the ethical concerns. The project is mindfully undertaken during Black History month of 2023.
